# Web Development Journey
Learning web development, this will depict my journey :)
Will list all the resources which I will use to learn them.

## Why I decided to learn Web Development?
Being a Mechatronics student I need to make IOT based projects and sometimes I just cant rely on third party services like blynk, adafruit IO and I need local servers hosted on microcontrollers like ESP8266/32 or Raspberry pies, which made me struggle a lot! Now I will learn web development and all the struggle will be finished along with future projects which I will try to make machine learning and AI stuff integrated with large data on the backend and stuff like that! Also asthetic websites make me think how are they built and will implement in my college annual fest [website](https://ENNOGY.github.io)
